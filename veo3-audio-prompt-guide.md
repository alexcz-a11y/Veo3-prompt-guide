## **Tips For Prompting Audio With Veo 3**

[Veo 3](https://leonardo.ai/veo-3/) introduced a powerful new capability to AI video generation: the ability to generate and synchronise video and audio, enhancing storytelling like never before. But with this cutting-edge tech comes a new creative challenge—how do you prompt for audio effectively to get the most compelling results?

The key lies in how you integrate, layer, and emotionally guide sound cues within the visual prompt. When incorporated well, audio goes beyond simply supporting the visuals—it deepens the atmosphere, sharpens the mood, and shapes the viewer’s emotional journey.

In this guide, we’ll walk through some do’s and don’ts, along with practical examples, to help you create scenes where sound feels realistic, immersive, and perfectly timed.

We’ll cover (with prompt examples):

1. Weaving audio into the narrative
2. Layering ambient sounds thoughtfully
3. Defining sound hierarchy
4. Using emotionally descriptive imagery
5. Emphasising sound for key moments

## **1\. Weave Audio into the narrative**

**DO: Integrate sound naturally into the scene**

When audio elements are woven into your prompt, you’ll get better prompt adherence and a richer sonic experience.

Example:

_The camera floats slowly through a flooded hallway of a long-abandoned hotel. Water ripples at ankle-height as the lens moves past overturned furniture and moldy wallpaper peeling from the walls._ **_Dripping echoes softly with every step,_** _each droplet landing like a pin on the glassy surface. The air is dense and wet. A loose ceiling tile shifts slightly, then falls behind the camera_ **_with a sharp splash._** _Ahead, a rusted elevator door creaks open,_ **_its metal groaning_** _in slow motion. Somewhere far above,_ **_a single thump reverberates faintly._** _The walls seem to hum faintly now—a low, electrical buzz, unsteady but constant. Dust motes drift through a beam of light that cuts in from a broken window._ **_The silence_** _between each sound is as thick as the air—stretched, eerie, alive._

**DON’T: List all audio prompts together at the end of the prompt**

Avoid isolating audio cues at the end like a checklist. It breaks immersion and leads to less accurate audio rendering and misaligned timing.

Example:

_The camera glides slowly through a flooded hallway of a long-abandoned hotel. Water ripples at ankle-height as it passes overturned furniture and walls coated in moldy, peeling wallpaper. A rusted elevator stands crooked at the far end. A beam of light cuts through a broken window, catching slow-drifting dust in midair. Furniture floats weightlessly against the walls, and the entire hallway appears untouched for decades._

**_Sounds: Distant dripping echoes throughout the space. A ceiling tile crashes into the water behind the camera. A faint metallic groan as the elevator door opens. A low, electrical buzz hums in the background. Muffled thump from above. Wet footstep echoes ripple through the silence_**

## **2\. Layer ambient sounds thoughtfully**

**DO: Layer 3-5 ambient sounds to create rich, vivid scenes.**

Ambient layers add depth to your scene. You can safely include around five audio elements without compromising audio integrity or video quality.

Example:

_Rain_ _falls steadily onto wet pavement,_ **_pattering softly_** _across rooftops and metal bins. A_ **_single, low thunderclap_** _rolls across the sky, echoing faintly between tall buildings before disappearing. A car passes faintly in the distance. A dog_ **_barks once_** _. A_ **_soft, tense melody_** **_plays_** _from an old radio somewhere above._

**DON’T: Overcomplicate your scenes with excessive or competing sounds.**

Layering more than five sound elements can cause audio to break down—cues may overlap poorly, or elements may be missed entirely.

Example:

_Rain_ _falls steadily onto wet pavement,_ **_pattering softly_** _across rooftops and metal bins. A_ **_single, low thunderclap_** _rolls across the sky, echoing faintly between tall buildings before disappearing. A car passes faintly in the distance. A dog_ **_barks once_** _. A_ **_soft, tense melody_** **_plays_** _from an old radio somewhere above._ **_A shout echoes_** _from two streets away._ **_A distant, deep gong_** _reverberates._

## **3\. Define sound hierarchy**

**DO: Create a clear sound hierarchy in your prompt**

In film, sound isn’t flat. Foreground audio (e.g. dialogue, key sound events) should stand out while background sounds remain audible but unobtrusive. Use phrasing like “cuts through” or “in the distance” to help Veo 3 understand what’s important.

Example:

_A crowded train station_ **_roars beneath pounding rain_** _._ _The station announcer’s_ **_voice cuts through faintly_** _—clear enough to understand, but_ **_softened by the ambient storm_** _.Passengers’_ **_chatter hums below_** _her words, layered yet subdued._ _Footsteps splash in shallow puddles,_ _syncing to hurried movements._ _Rain thrums hard_ _on the glass ceiling above,_ _filling every pause in speech with sound_ _._ **_In the distance, a train brakes sharply_** _with a metallic screech,_ **_echoing_** _behind her steady_ _voice._

**DON’T: Leave all sound cues on the same level**

Without structure, sounds blend into a wall of undifferentiated noise, leading to flat or mistimed audio.

Example:

_A crowded, noisy train station. Rain can be heard falling heavily on the roof. The station announcer speaks. Passengers chatter and their footsteps splash as they walk. A train breaks loudly._

## **4 . Use emotionally descriptive imagery**

**DO: Use emotional cues in your language to set your mood.**

Even with great visuals, a mismatch in sound mood—like upbeat music in a horror scene—can break immersion. Veo 3 responds well to emotional language embedded in the environment.

Terms like “chirping birds” suggest calm, “wind” implies tension, and “echoes” convey isolation.

Example:

_A long country road stretches toward distant hills, painted gold by the fading sun. A child walks alone, small against the vast sky, swinging a worn backpack at their side._ **_Birds chirp faintly_** _in the distance, and a_ **_soft breeze rustles_** _through tall grass. An_ **_ambient melody begins—light piano, gentle strings_** _—subtle and warm. Footsteps on gravel_ **_crunch softly_** _, unhurried. The moment feels peaceful, full of quiet optimism. Somewhere far off, a_ **_dog barks once_** _. The child smiles slightly, still walking._

**DON’T: Use abstract emotional terms like “sad” or “tense” to describe sound.**

Instead, let the description and sound choices imply the emotion.

Example:

_A long country road stretches toward distant hills, painted gold by the fading sun. A child walks alone, small against the vast sky, swinging a worn backpack at their side._ **_Birds chirp_** _and a_ **_breeze rustles_** _through tall grass. A_ **_sad melody begins_** _. Footsteps on gravel_ **_crunch_** _. The moment feels peaceful, full of quiet optimism. Somewhere far off, a_ **_dog barks once_** _. The child smiles slightly, still walking._

## **5 . Emphasise sound events for key moments**

**DO: Use simple, vivid instructions for impactful sound events**

Veo 3 excels at generating sharp, well-timed audio when clear events are described (e.g. glass shattering, gunshots, screams). Aligning sound to key moments helps ensure realism and emotional weight.

Example:

_Inside an abandoned art gallery, the camera pans across dimly lit hallways. Dusty frames lean crooked against the walls, and rain seeps through cracked ceilings, dripping faintly onto the marble floor. The lens slows near a glass display case, its surface dull with grime. Just_ **_as the shot centers on the case, a single pane shatters with a violent, ringing crack,shards scattering across the floor like metallic chimes.The sound cuts sharply through the soft ambience of wind and distant rain._** _The camera holds, catching glints of broken glass in the dim light as_ **_echoes fade into the cavernous hall._**

## **Bonus tips**

- Don’t rely on onomatopoeia alone (e.g. “Boom!” without context)
- Don’t contradict audio expectations (e.g. silence in a busy crowd, without reason)
- Don’t repeat the same cue too often (e.g. multiple “drips” in a scene)

With Veo 3’s powerful audio capabilities, you can do more than just add sound—you can direct it to create an immersive, emotionally resonant scene that puts viewers right in the moment.
